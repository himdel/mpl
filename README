mpl is a ruby cli mplayer wrapper

It stops screensaver, music player, saves volume and play state and restores it afterwards.
(Currently only xscreensaver and mpd is supported.)

It also
* recurses 1 level into directories if a directory is given,
* plays current dir if nothing is given,
* tries to find incomplete filenames:
 $ mpl foo/2x13
 plays foo/*2x13* if no foo/2x13 exists
 if no foo/*2x13* exists, it calls locate
* excludes files with certain extensions, you can add extensions using -X
* randomizes files or directories, picking first N files:
 -R		randomize files		(keeps subsequent files with increasing _\d+ suffix together) (1x02-Ep_1.avi and 1x03-Ep_2.avi will be kept together but 1x02-Ep1.avi and 1x03-Ep2.avi won't)
 -R/	randomize dirs		(randomizes order of directories but not the files within)
 -R1	randomize files | head -n1		(same as -R but play only the first file)
	(works for any number)
 -DF		-framedrop -fs
 -X	exclude extension	(-X jpeg will ignore all .jpeg files) (note that mpl excludes some extensions by default, grep rejary)
* any other args are passed to mplayer, but note you have to use -ao=null instead of -ao null (for all options with params)
* if all files are in 1 dir, adds options from $dir/.mpl

TODO list:
* gnome-screensaver and kscreensaver support
* other music players than mpd
* maybe proper recursion
* remembering where you stopped (requires a pipe to mplayer -something)
* config file in ~/.mpl
* in there a way to add more commands for before and after
